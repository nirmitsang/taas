Task 4.3: Handle parallel result aggregation

Modify JUnit output to use CI_NODE_INDEX
Update artifacts to collect all result files
Verify GitLab merges results correctly
Test report accuracy with parallel runs


Task 4.4: Measure and validate performance

Benchmark sequential execution time
Measure parallel execution time
Verify 40%+ improvement
Document performance gains




Story 5: Support Multiple Test Frameworks
As a platform team, we need to support different test frameworks so that teams can use their preferred testing tools.
Tasks:

Task 5.1: Add BDD framework support

Install behave package
Add detection for .feature files
Configure appropriate test runner
Test with feature file examples


Task 5.2: Support custom dependencies

Check for requirements.txt in test directory

Handle installation failures
Test with various dependency files


Task 5.3: Add framework detection logic

Detect pytest vs behave vs others
Run appropriate command per framework
Add framework type as optional variable
Document supported frameworks




Story 6: Create Documentation and Training Materials
As a platform team, we need to provide comprehensive documentation so that application teams can successfully adopt our platform.
Tasks:

Task 6.1: Write user documentation

Create getting started guide
Document test repository structure
Add step-by-step usage instructions
Include screenshots of GitLab UI


Task 6.2: Create sample test repository

Setup example repository with pytest tests
Add feature files and step definitions
Include requirements.txt example
Add README with explanations


Task 6.3: Develop troubleshooting guide

Document common errors and solutions
Add FAQ section
Include debugging tips
Provide support contact information


Task 6.4: Create trigger examples

Write curl command examples
Create bash script for triggering
Document API trigger usage
Add CI integration examples




Story 7: Implement Monitoring and Reporting
As a platform team, we need to monitor platform usage and health so that we can ensure reliability and track adoption.
Tasks:
